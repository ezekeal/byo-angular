# Reporting Issues in "Build Your Own AngularJS"

If you find a bug, typo, or some other kind of issue in the book content or in the source code, I would appreciate
it if you reported it to the [Issues](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs/issues) section of this
repository.

When reporting an issue, please use the following conventions:

* Prefix the issue title with the corresponding page number (e.g. "P45")
* Assign a chapter label to the issue (one of "chapter1", "chapter2", etc.)

Your feedback is much appreciated!
